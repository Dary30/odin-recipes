        <li>
            Put 100g plain flour, 2 large eggs, 300ml milk, 15ml suflower or vegetable
            oil and a pinch of salt into a bowl or large jug, then whisk to a smooth batter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set aside for 30 mins to rest if you have time, or start cooking straight away.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set a medium frying pan or crepe pan over a medium heat and carefully wipe it
            with some oiled kitchen paper.
        </li>
        <li>
            When hot, cook your crepes for 1 min on each side until golden, keeping them
            warm in a low oven as you go.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve with lemon wedges and caster sugar, or your favourite filling. Once cold,
            you can layer the crepes between baking parchment, then wrap in cling film and
            freeze for up to 2 months.
        </li>
