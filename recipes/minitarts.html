            Use shop-bought pastry to make our easy bakewell tarts. Simply
            layer jam, frangipane and icing inside a shortcrust case for a
            nostalgic teatime treat.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 x 320g sheets of all butter shortcrust pastry</li>
        <li>For the frangipane:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>120g butter, softened</li>
            <li>120g golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>8g plain flour</li>
            <li>110g ground almonds</li>
            <li>90g cherry jam</li>
        </ul>
        <li>For the icing:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>200g icing sugar</li>
            <li>12 cherries</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat the oven to 180C/ 160C fan/ gas 4. Lightly butter a 12 hole muffin
            tin. Unroll the sheet of pastry and use a 10cm circular pastry cutter to
            cut 12 circles out of the pastry sheet. Press the cut circles into the holes
            of the tin, making sure they come right up and slightly over the top - pushing
            out any creases. Chill the pastry in the fridge for 20 mins. Scrunch up
            10cm x 10cm squares of baking paper and then un-scrunch and use to line each
            of the pastry tarts, then fill with baking beans, rice or dried pulses.
            Bake for 10 mins, then remove the paper and beans and bake for 10 mins
            longer, until golden brown. Set aside to cool a little.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the filling by beating together the butter and sugar until light and
            fluffy, then whisk in the egg, followed by the flour(the flour will prevent
            the mixture from splitting). Fold in the ground almonds. Spoon 7g of cherry
            jam into each of the pastry shells, followed by 7g of the frangipane mixture.
            Bake for 20 mins, until the frangipane is golden and springy. Set aside to cool
            completely. Neaten the edges of the pastry with a small knife or scissors.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix the icing sugar with 30ml of water. Spread the icing over each of the tarts,
            top each with a cherry, leave to set for 20 mins, then serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
